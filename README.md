# a-simple-landing-page

This is a simple landing page that I made as exercise for my course on TheOdinoProject; I decided to follow the entire path of the course on TheOdinProject, which includes HTML and CSS, even though I have prior knowledge in these areas.
This design and layout don't fit in my personal taste, of course this is not an ugly layout, but usually I do things differently.
